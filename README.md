# Digital Image Processing – Assignments

This repository contains **Assignment 1 and Assignment 2** completed within the scope of the **GMT234 – Digital Imaging and Interpretation** course at Hacettepe University.

The assignments focus on fundamental digital image processing techniques implemented using **Python**, with an emphasis on understanding pixel-level operations and basic image enhancement methods without relying heavily on external image processing libraries.

## Assignment 1 – Basic Image Analysis
In the first assignment, an RGB image was analyzed by:
- Separating the image into Red, Green, and Blue grayscale channels
- Generating and interpreting histograms for each channel
- Creating negative versions of grayscale images
- Applying thresholding and connected component analysis to automatically detect and count objects (birds) in the scene

These steps were used to understand contrast behavior, intensity distribution, and basic object detection principles.

## Assignment 2 – Image Enhancement
The second assignment focused on enhancing a low-contrast image by:
- Converting the image to grayscale
- Applying averaging filters for noise reduction
- Performing histogram equalization to improve contrast
- Applying edge enhancement to highlight object boundaries

Visual outputs were generated after each processing step to clearly demonstrate the effect of each method.

## Tools and Implementation
- Programming Language: **Python**
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, basic image I/O utilities
- All processing steps were implemented manually to strengthen conceptual understanding.
